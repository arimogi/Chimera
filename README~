Chimera is a special framework to build special CMS.
It is built upon codeIgniter, and several plugin (including HMVC, sparks, ion_auth and Phil Sturgeon template).

In Chimera, there is no public and admin controller.
If you need authentication or authorization, I've provide the function, but you should do it by yourself
